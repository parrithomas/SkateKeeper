# SkateKeeper
A personal take on creating a small score-keeping app.

In a game of SKATE player one will name a trick. If player one lands that trick, player two gets one chance to also land that trick. If they don't, they get a letter. First one to complete the word SKATE is the loser.

The app is built in HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.
CSS layout is sprinkled with some Flexbox for layout.

Javascript includes features to players choose between a game length of SKATE or KICKFLIP, disable the game when a winner has been declared and feeds back info to used via DOM manipulation.
